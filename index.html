                <p>My name is Chen Li. I am a first-generation immigrant from China. I was born in Chengdu, Sichuan province. 
                    And I came to Utah when I was eight years old. I graduated from the University of Utah in 2009 with a Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineer, 
                    and met my wife the following year in a study abroad in Japan. Since then, I have accumulated 5 years of experiences working in QA data analysis and SAP QA 
                    module sysadmin positions.
                </p>

                <p>I currently work at a company called MasterControl, whose software is primarily Document Control, but whose application extends
                    to Medical and Pharmaceutical industries. I love my job but also would love to expand my skillset to include web development and coding.
